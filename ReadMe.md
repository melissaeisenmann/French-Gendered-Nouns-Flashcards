This is a flashcard quizzer run in Python.

You will be presented a French word and asked if it is feminine or masculine. Type "f" or "m" and hit Enter to make your guess. The program will either confirm it is correct or notify you that you were wrong. In either case, you will be shown the word again with the articles "un"/"une" and "le"/"la"/"l'" to help you remember the word with its gendered article.

The base code originally came from an O'Reilly on-demand "Introduction to Python" course by Jessica McKellar and was being used with U.S. state capitols. We were encouraged to play around with it. Meanwhile, I've been trying to relearn my high school French via Duolingo. I have a hard time remembering the noun genders correctly so a flashcard quizzer is perfect for me. 

Admittedly, the current version of the code is too specific to be used with anything else. And the list of French nouns consists solely of words Duolingo has "taught" me, so it's rather short. However, it is possible to add additional words to that noun list so it can grow with whoever wants to use it.

If you find any errors, please let me know!
